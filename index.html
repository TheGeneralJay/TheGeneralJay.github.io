      <div id="about">
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Amanda Gurney, a student currently attending George
          Brown College in Toronto, Ontario. I am in my sixth and final semester
          in the Computer Programming and Analysis advanced diploma program. I
          am currently a SAP (System Analysis Program Development), Inventory,
          and Pricing specialist at Morello's Independent Grocer in
          Peterborough, ON. With my collegues, we aid this branch of Loblaws by
          keeping the store inventory up to date and adjusting pricing or
          electronic label issues as they come. I also find myself doubling as
          technical support and often become the line of communication between
          our IT help desk and our in-store employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this experience at work, I recognized that I wanted to dig deeper
          into the world of programming and software in general. I applied for
          this program through George Brown College and started off with very
          little background in any meaningful programming languages. Throughout
          my time learning, I have applied new topics to assignments as they
          arise and have dedicated myself to being a lifelong learner -- as that
          is what we must be in any rapidly advancing field. I am available for
          contact easily through my email or phone number, each listed above on
          this page. If you are interested in working with me on a project, or
          just want to discuss more, please feel free to get in touch!
        </p>
