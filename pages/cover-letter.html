        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p class="letter-body">
          I am contacting you to express my intrigue in the software development
          position that was advertised on Indeed in March. This summer, I will
          be a fresh graduate with an Ontario College Advanced Diploma in
          Computer Programming and Analysis. During my time as a student at
          George Brown College, I have learned and utilized countless strategies
          to developing applications of a wide variety, from CLI mini games to
          full stack web applications. It is with this range of knowledge that I
          believe I would be an undeniable asset to the position you seek to
          fill.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
          While working as an SAP Operations and Price Checking Clerk at
          Morello’s Independent Grocer, I have been able to put forth a large
          amount of time and effort to making my department thrive in an
          ever-changing environment. Due to my knowledge in the technical field,
          I have been able to piece together helpful guides for new hires, as
          well as aid my colleagues in troubleshooting countless pricing and
          electronic tag issues as they arise. I truly believe that I contribute
          an indisputable amount of growth within my department and would be
          capable of applying that to the position you are offering as well.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
          Additionally, I am an incredibly swift learner. Starting my
          programming career in my first semester with zero background
          knowledge, I have quickly soared through the ranks of my peers,
          currently sitting at a GPA of 3.98. Every semester I am met with
          challenges that I strive to overcome and finish out each finals week
          by making the Dean’s Honour List for that term. I continuously stand
          out to my professors and fellow students, even gaining a
          recommendation to pursue a position tutoring English at the college.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
          It is with all of this that I believe I would be the perfect fit for
          the position you advertised in March of this year. Not only have I
          proven to be an asset to my workplace at my local YIG branch of
          Loblaws, but I have actively achieved goals to meet the ever-changing
          standards of learning software development. I am dedicated to being a
          lifelong learner, forever adapting to embrace the shift in technology,
          from primitive to artificially advanced.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-body">
          I wish to extend my most sincere gratitude that you have given time to
          read through my application. If you are interested in utilizing my
          skills in this field, I urge you to contact me through my email at
          amandagurns@hotmail.ca, or my mobile phone number at (705) 868-8939.
        </p>

        <p>
          Best wishes, <br />
